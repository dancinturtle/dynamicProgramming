50 top dynamic programming problems in Python

I got it in my head that I absolutely must solve all 50 of these dynamic programming problems found [here](https://blog.usejournal.com/top-50-dynamic-programming-practice-problems-4208fed71aa3).

Since I've been using Python lately, I'm doing them in Python with Jupyter Notebooks.

Completed so far:

1. Longest common subsequence
2. Finding all longest common subsequences
3. Longest common substring
4. Longest palindromic subsequence
5. Longest repeated subsequence
5. Diff utility
