    "### The Levenshtein distance (edit distance) problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit distance is a way of quantifying how different two strings are from one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (ie, insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to chaned one word into the other. Each of these operations has a unit cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Levenshtein distance between kitten and sitting is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "kitten -> sitten (substitution of s for k)\n",
    "sitten -> sittin (substitution of i for e)\n",
    "sittin -> sitting (insertion of g at the end)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has optimal substructure. The problem can be broken into smaller, simple subproblems, which can also be broken down, until the solution becomes trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think about transforming X[1...m] into Y[1...n] by first thinking about transforming substring x[1...i] into Y[1...j]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 1: We have reached the end of either substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "If substring X is empty, insert all remaining characters of Y into X. The cost is equal to the number of characters left in substring Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "If substring Y is empty, delete all remaining characters of X. The cost is equal to the number of characters left in X.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 2: The last characters of substrings X and Y are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the last characters match, nothing needs to be done. Keep going for X[1...i-1] and Y[1...j-1]. No cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 3: The last characters of substrings X and Y are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the last characters are different, return the minimum of the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Insert the last character of Y into X. Then continue with the recursion. The size of Y reduces by 1 and X remains the same. ```('ABA', 'ABC') -> ('ABAC', 'ABC') -> ('ABA', 'AB')```\n",
    "2. Delete the last character of X. Then continue with the recursion. ```('ABA', 'ABC') -> ('AB', 'ABC')```\n",
    "3. Substitute the current character of X by the current character of Y. Then continue with the recursion. ```('ABA', 'ABC') -> ('ABC', 'ABC') -> ('AB', 'AB')```\n"
